# 🤖 AI Council

A powerful web application for comparing responses from multiple AI models side-by-side. Get insights from Claude, OpenAI GPT, and Google Gemini all at once, with an integrated summary that highlights key differences and similarities.

## ✨ Features

- **🔄 Dynamic Model Selection** - Automatically fetches the latest available models from all providers
- **📊 Side-by-Side Comparison** - See responses from multiple AI models simultaneously
- **🧠 Integrated Summary** - AI-powered analysis of differences and similarities between responses
- **🎨 Beautiful Web Interface** - Clean, modern UI with responsive design
- **⚡ Fast Performance** - Concurrent API calls for quick results
- **🔒 Secure** - API keys stored locally, never exposed in code
- **💻 CLI Available** - Also includes a command-line interface

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- API keys for the providers you want to use:
  - [Claude API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
  - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  - [Gemini API Key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tomvannuenen/ai-council.git
   cd ai-council
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up API keys in your `.zshrc` file**
   ```bash
   echo 'export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-claude-api-key"' >> ~/.zshrc
   echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"' >> ~/.zshrc
   echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

   > **Note**: You don't need all three API keys. The app will work with whatever keys you provide.

## 🎯 Usage

### Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Ask your question**
   - Type your question in the text area
   - Select which models you want to use from the dropdowns
   - Toggle "Include integrated summary" if desired
   - Click "Ask AI Council"

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Ask a question to all available models
npm run cli ask "What's the best programming language to learn in 2024?"

# Include an integrated summary
npm run cli ask "What's the best programming language to learn in 2024?" --summary
```

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Dynamic Model Fetching**: The app calls each provider's API to get their latest available models
2. **Model Selection**: Choose specific models from dropdown menus for each provider
3. **Concurrent Queries**: Your question is sent to all selected models simultaneously
4. **Response Display**: Results are shown side-by-side with clear model identification
5. **Integrated Summary**: Claude analyzes all responses to provide insights on similarities, differences, and recommendations

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

The app reads API keys from your shell environment. Supported variable names:

- `CLAUDE_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`

### Model Selection

Models are dynamically fetched from each provider's API, ensuring you always have access to the latest releases. The app automatically:

- Filters for text generation models only
- Sorts by release date (newest first)
- Handles API errors gracefully
- Shows model creation dates

## 🎨 Screenshots
